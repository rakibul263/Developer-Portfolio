        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p style="margin-bottom: 5%">
          I am a dedicated, organized and methodical individual. I have good
          interpersonal skills, I am an excellent team worker and very willing
          to learn and develop new skills. I love to play with technology.Black
          is my favourite color. I like eating spicy foods because it gives me
          the happiness that I want. I also like watching television such as
          Movies and Cartoons especially, when I am bored. In my 20 years of
          existence in this world, I already experienced so many things from
          begin a crying baby until I entered this age where I am no longer a
          child. I matured enough to have my own decision in my life but not
          literally independent for now. I study hard for me to be able to
          graduate and as a Computer Science student, my dream in life is to
          become a future job in a tech giant company.
